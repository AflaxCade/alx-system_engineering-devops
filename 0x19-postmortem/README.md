# Postmortem: Unexpected Service Disruption

## Issue Summary
- **Duration**: From 2023-11-04 14:30 UTC to 2023-11-04 16:00 UTC
- **Impact**: Our primary authentication service experienced intermittent outages, causing login failures for approximately **20%** of our users.
- **Root Cause**: A misconfigured load balancer led to uneven distribution of traffic, overwhelming some backend servers.

## Timeline
- **14:30 UTC**: Issue detected via monitoring alerts showing increased error rates during peak usage hours.
- **14:35 UTC**: Engineers noticed elevated latency in authentication requests.
- **14:40 UTC**: Investigation began, focusing on backend services and database connections.
- **14:50 UTC**: Initial assumption: Database replication lag due to recent schema changes.
- **15:00 UTC**: Debugging paths explored: Checked database health, reviewed query performance, and analyzed network traffic.
- **15:15 UTC**: Escalated incident to the DevOps team for further analysis.
- **15:30 UTC**: Load balancer misconfiguration identified as the root cause.
- **15:45 UTC**: Load balancer settings adjusted to evenly distribute traffic.
- **16:00 UTC**: Service fully restored.

## Root Cause and Resolution
- **Cause**: The load balancer was configured with an outdated algorithm, leading to uneven distribution of requests. Some backend servers were overwhelmed, causing authentication failures.
- **Resolution**: Load balancer settings were updated to use a consistent hashing algorithm, ensuring balanced traffic distribution.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
1. **Monitoring Enhancements**:
   - Implement real-time monitoring for load balancer metrics (e.g., connection counts, request rates).
   - Set up alerts for abnormal behavior.
2. **Regular Load Testing**:
   - Conduct periodic load tests to identify bottlenecks and capacity limits.
   - Simulate traffic spikes to validate system resilience.
3. **Documentation Update**:
   - Document load balancer configuration best practices.
   - Train engineers on load balancer management.
4. **Automated Configuration Audits**:
   - Implement automated checks for load balancer configurations.
   - Regularly review and validate settings.
5. **Incident Response Playbook**:
   - Create a detailed playbook for handling authentication service disruptions.
   - Define roles, escalation paths, and communication channels.

By addressing these measures, we aim to prevent similar incidents and enhance our system's reliability. ðŸš€
