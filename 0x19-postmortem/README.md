# When Load Balancers Forget How to Share: A Web Stack Outage Comedy

## Issue Summary
- **Duration**: Start time: 2023-11-01 10:00 AM (UTC), End time: 2023-11-01 11:30 AM (UTC)
- **Impact**: The great web stack hiccup, leaving 30% of our users hanging in the digital void.
- **Root Cause**: The drama unfolded because our load balancer had a 'too-much-favoritism' complex.

## Timeline
- **Detection**: The plot thickened at 2023-11-01 10:00 AM (UTC) when our alert system went, "Houston, we have a problem."
- **Actions Taken**: Our tech heroes jumped into action, Sherlock Holmes-style, chasing ghosts in the form of database and app server issues.
- **Misleading Paths**: They ventured into the database server, tried to pump up app servers, but it was a wild goose chase.
- **Escalation**: The bat signal went out to DevOps and the Network team, suspecting network shenanigans.
- **Resolution**: The knight in shining armor was finally found - a wonky load balancer! Corrected and saved the day.

## Root Cause and Resolution
- **Root Cause**: It was a classic case of load balancer favoritism. Some servers got all the love, while others were ghosted, leading to web chaos.

- **Resolution**: The load balancer got therapy, learned to share nicely, and a monitoring babysitter was hired to ensure it plays fair.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
- To prevent future load balancer meltdowns, we'll:
  1. Throw regular load balancer audits to catch it in the act.
  2. Slap on automated monitoring glasses for load balancer supervision.
  3. Write a load balancer diary for a tell-all memoir.
  4. Give the engineering team load balancer config therapy.
  5. Install a direct hotline to DevOps and Network teams for superhero rescue missions.

This outage taught us that even load balancers can have a bad hair day. But with these measures, we'll make sure they never steal the spotlight again!
